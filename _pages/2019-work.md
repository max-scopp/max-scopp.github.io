Starting with mods forHalo: Combat EvolvedandGrand Theft Auto IVI've been starting to make Websites and internet-software to host my mods, which later got me my first job starting my professional experience. In which I started developing Websites and supported customers in managing their CMS.

Due to my experiences in CMS Software (Typo3 in particular) I was able to gain, I have moved to Bremen and started persuing an apprentice as developer. In those years, I was also able to grasp a deeper understanding of social marketing and SEO optimizations.

Continuing with this trend, at this point in time I have spend overthousands of hoursprofessionally as well as privately developing software in over 30 projects. Most of them where heavily content-driven.

Soonly after my apprentice I expanded my knowledge into the financial sector, transforming a legacy application into a modern web-application.
